Hello everyone!

It's a long time since I updated my solutions last time.

I'm currently exchanging in the **University of Waterloo**, Canada. And I have a course about algorithm *CS 466: Design and Analysis of Algorithms* this term. I'm so interested in algorithm design and analysis that I want read the textbook **CLRS** again as well as fix the error in my solution, translate to English and add new chapters solution(**Goal: covering all the chapter of CLRS**).

Also, I have read some other algorithm or theoretical textbooks and I will try my best to share my solution for the problems in these books.

* [Algorithms](http://www.amazon.ca/Algorithms-Sanjoy-Dasgupta/dp/0073523402) *Sanjoy Dasgupta, Christos Papadimitriou and Umesh Vazirani*
* [Probability and Computing: Randomized Algorithms and Probabilistic Analysis](http://www.amazon.ca/Probability-Computing-Randomized-Algorithms-Probabilistic/dp/0521835402) *Michael Mitzenmacher and Eli Upfal*
* [Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation](http://www.amazon.ca/Introduction-Automata-Theory-Languages-Computation/dp/0321455363) *John E. Hopcroft, Rajeev Motwani and Jeffrey D. Ullman*

**Maybe this work will last for 1 years, since I will apply Master/PhD program for the future study and complete a final project(a Starcraft AI using BWAPI) for my Bachelor's Degree in the future several months.**

If you want to join me or discuss some problems with me, feel free to email me or connect me on Github. Hope for more and more participants.

Thank you.
