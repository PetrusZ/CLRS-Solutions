\subsection*{Problem 23-4 Alternative minimum-spanning-tree algorithms}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item	Correct! \\
		By the conclusion of Exercise 23.1-5 \\
		The running time of the algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(E(E + V))$
	\item	Wrong! \\
		The running time of the algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(E\alpha(V))$
	\item	Correct! \\
		By the conclusion of Exercise 23.1-5 \\
		The running time of the algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(VE)$
\end{enumerate}
Any better solution ???
