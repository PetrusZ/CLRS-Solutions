\subsection*{Problem 26-4 Updating maximum flow}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item	Just execute one more iteration of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.  \\
		Argument: \\
		If the edge $(u, v)$ does not cross a minimum cut, then incresing the capacity of the edge $(u, v)$ does not change the capacity of the minimum cut as well as maximum flow. \\
		If the edge $(u, v)$ does cross a minimum cut, then it increases the capacity of the minimum cut as well as maximum flow at most 1. \\
		The both cases need only find augmenting path one more time. \\
		
		The running time of the algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(V + E)$
	\item	\begin{enumerate}
			\item	the new flow $f'(u, v) = f(u, v) - 1$
			\item	if there is a augmenting path from $u$ to $v$, then augment an unit flow along the augmenting path \\
				otherwise, find augmenting paths from $u$ to $s$ and from $t$ to $v$, decreasing an unit flow along the augmenting path
		\end{enumerate}
		The running time of the algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(V + E)$
\end{enumerate}
